Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine\u2014anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church\u2013Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is generally considered to be the most basic iteration of a Turing machine?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a68", "answers": [{"text": "A deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "deterministic", "answer_start": 2}, {"text": "deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 2}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What fixed set of factors determine the actions of a deterministic Turing machine", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a69", "answers": [{"text": "rules", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "rules", "answer_start": 91}, {"text": "a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions", "answer_start": 76}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the term used to identify a deterministic Turing machine that has additional random bits?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a6a", "answers": [{"text": "A probabilistic Turing machine", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "probabilistic", "answer_start": 132}, {"text": "probabilistic Turing machine", "answer_start": 132}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of Turing machine is capable of multiple actions and extends into a variety of computational paths?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a6b", "answers": [{"text": "A non-deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 398}, {"text": "non-deterministic", "answer_start": 400}, {"text": "non-deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 400}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the term given to algorithms that utilize random bits?", "id": "56e1aff7cd28a01900c67a6c", "answers": [{"text": "randomized algorithms", "answer_start": 375}, {"text": "randomized algorithms", "answer_start": 375}, {"text": "randomized algorithms", "answer_start": 375}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 2}], "question": "What uses a flexible set of rules to determine its future actions?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac0e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "probabilistic Turing machine", "answer_start": 132}], "question": "What is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random ribbons?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac0f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The ability to make probabilistic decisions", "answer_start": 232}], "question": "What does not often help algorithms solve problems more efficiently?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac10", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "non-deterministic Turing machine", "answer_start": 400}], "question": "Which machine allows the machine to have multiple possible past actions from a given state?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac11", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches,", "answer_start": 632}], "question": "How is one way that one should not view non-determinism?", "id": "5ad546c75b96ef001a10ac12", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions.

Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete Boolean satisfiability problem."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What tactic did researchers employ to offset the former deficit of work surrounding the complexity of algorithmic problems?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c14", "answers": [{"text": "foundations were laid out", "answer_start": 110}, {"text": "numerous foundations were laid out", "answer_start": 101}, {"text": "numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who was the most influential researcher among those grappling with the deficit of work surrounding the complexity posed by algorithmic problems?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c15", "answers": [{"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}, {"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}, {"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What theoretical device is attributed to Alan Turing?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c16", "answers": [{"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}, {"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}, {"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year was the Alan Turing's definitional model of a computing device received?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c17", "answers": [{"text": "1936", "answer_start": 245}, {"text": "1936", "answer_start": 245}, {"text": "1936", "answer_start": 245}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In the most basic sense what did a Turing machine emulate?", "id": "56e200e4cd28a01900c67c18", "answers": [{"text": "a computer", "answer_start": 319}, {"text": "a computer", "answer_start": 319}, {"text": "a computer", "answer_start": 319}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "foundations", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "What were laid out by various companies?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "foundations were laid out", "answer_start": 110}], "question": "What tactic did companies employ to offset the former deficit of work surrounding the complexity of algorithmic problems?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Alan Turing", "answer_start": 230}], "question": "Who was the least influential researcher working on the complexity posed by algorithmic problems?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Turing machines", "answer_start": 211}], "question": "What device did Alan Turning invent in 1974?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "computer", "answer_start": 321}], "question": "What was the Turning calculator a robust and flexible simplification of?", "id": "5ad56fe65b96ef001a10aec6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers.

ITV were the current rights holders, and fought hard to retain the new rights. ITV had increased its offer from \u00a318m to \u00a334m per year to keep control of the rights. BSkyB joined forces with the BBC to make a counter bid. The BBC was given the highlights of most of the matches, while BSkyB paying \u00a3304m for the Premier League rights, would give them a monopoly of all live matches, up to 60 per year from the 1992 season.  Murdoch described sport as a \"battering ram\" for pay-television, providing a strong customer base. A few weeks after the deal, ITV went to the High Court to get an injunction as it believed their bid details had been leaked before the decision was taken. ITV also asked the Office of Fair Trading to investigate since it believed Rupert Murdoch's media empire via its newspapers had influenced the deal.
